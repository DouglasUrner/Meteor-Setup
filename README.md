Meteor-Setup
============

Notes on getting started using the Meteor web framework (including Meteorite and Atmosphere).

Install Meteor
--------------

curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh

This command installs Meteor for you. The default location is ~/.meteor.

Install Meteorite
-----------------

Meteorite depends on npm (the Node.js which Meteor also uses (I think)). So if you don't have Node.js (http://nodejs.org) installed, get it first, otherwise skip the next section.

Install Node.js:

* Go to http://nodejs.org and click on the Download button to download the installer.
* Double-click the installer to open it.
* The default install is for all users in /usr/local/bin.

Installing Metorite with npm:

* sudo npm install -g meteorite
